1. Navigate to the ECS console using the provided URL:
https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2/clusters/llmops-live-cluster/services?region=eu-north-1

2. Locate and select the 'llmops-live-service' in the services list

3. Click on the 'Events' tab to review recent deployment events and identify specific failure reasons

4. Check the 'Deployments' tab to see if there are any failed deployments

5. Review the task definition associated with the service:
   - Click on the 'Configuration' tab
   - Under 'Task definition', click on the task definition name

6. In the task definition details, verify:
   - The container image URL is correct and accessible
   - Environment variables are properly set
   - Resource allocations (CPU, memory) are appropriate

7. If issues are found in the task definition:
   - Create a new revision of the task definition with necessary corrections
   - Update the service to use the new task definition revision

8. If no issues are found in the task definition, check the service configuration:
   - Go back to the service details page
   - Click 'Edit' to review and update service settings

9. Verify network configuration:
   - Ensure the VPC, subnets, and security groups are correctly set
   - Check that the necessary ports are open in the security groups

10. Review service auto scaling settings (if enabled) to ensure they are appropriate

11. After making necessary changes, force a new deployment:
    - On the service details page, click 'Update'
    - Without changing any settings, scroll to the bottom and click 'Update service'

12. Monitor the new deployment in the 'Deployments' tab

13. If the issue persists, check CloudWatch logs:
    - Go to the CloudWatch console
    - Navigate to 'Log groups'
    - Find and review logs for the ECS service and tasks

14. Based on the findings from CloudWatch logs, make additional adjustments to the task definition or service configuration as needed

15. If the problem continues, consider rolling back to a previous known-good task definition version temporarily while further investigating the root cause
